### Q1:
*There are a number of seismic recordings from earthquakes and from mining explosions in the R package "astsa". All of the data are in the dataframe  "eqexp", but two specific recordings are in  "EQ5" and "EX6", the fifth earthquake and the sixth explosion, respectively. The data represent two phases or arrivals along the surface, denoted by P (t = 1,…, 1024) and S (t = 1025,…, 2048), at a seismic recording station. The recording instruments are in Scandinavia and monitor a Russian nuclear testing site. The general problem of interest is in distinguishing between these waveforms in order to maintain a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. 
To compare the earthquake and explosion signals,*

**(a)** *Plot the two series separately in a multifigure plot with two rows and one column.*

```{r plotdata, echo =FALSE}
library("aTSA")
str(astsa::eqexp)
p_index = 1:1024
time_series_name = c("EQ5", "EX6")
time_series_to_be_plotted = astsa::eqexp[p_index, time_series_name] #row vector,column vector
plot.ts(time_series_to_be_plotted,
        plot.type = "multiple",
        nc = 1, #number of columns parameter
        main = "P waves") #explicit plot.ts call


```

**(b)** *Plot the two series on the same graph using different colors or different line types.*

```{r secondplot, echo = FALSE}
s_index = p_index+1024
colors_name = c("red", "blue")#red is p waves, blue is s waves (I believe)
time_series_to_be_plotted = astsa::eqexp[s_index, time_series_name]#time period/index,columns of TS data
plot.ts(time_series_to_be_plotted,
        plot.type="single",
        main="P & S Waves",
        col=colors_name, #associate red with column EQ5, blue with column EX6
        ylab="somethings")
legend("bottomleft",
       time_series_name,
       col=colors_name,
       lty=1)
```

**(c)** *Would you treat the earthquake and explosion series as stationary or non-stationary? Support your answer.*
 Let's take a look at the acf:

```{r acf}
acf(time_series_to_be_plotted)

```
