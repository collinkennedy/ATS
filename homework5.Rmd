**Question 1**

**a)** *Plot the sample acf and pacf of xt and determine an appropriate ARMA model for the data.*
```{r}
acf(cmort)#doesn't look stationary
pacf(cmort) #potentially an AR(2)
```

**b)** *Fit the model to the data by using the function "sarima()" in R package "astsa" and then determine the fitted model.*
```{r}
model =sarima(cmort,p= 2,d=0,q=0) #how do we know what order model to fit? I based it on pacf

str(model)

model$ttable #what is the xmean output
model$fit 

```

**c)** *Use the fitted model to find the 1,…,4-step-ahead prediction of the series, i.e. 𝑥𝑛𝑛+𝑘,𝑘=1,2,3,4, and compare your computation with the one obtained by applying the R function "sarima.for()". Please show the details of your computations.*
```{r}
sarima(cmort,p= 2,d=0,q=0) #fit an arima(2,0,0) model to the cmort time series data

pred = sarima.for(cmort,2,0,0,n.ahead = 4) #calculate the 4 step ahead predictions
#str(pred) # I get different predicted values when I do the calculation by hand...

#sarima.for predictions:
#pred$pred


#predictions "by hand"
phi1 =  0.4301
phi2 = 0.4424
mu = 88.8538
oneStepAhead =  phi1*(85.49-88.8538) + phi2*(89.43-88.8538) + mu #add back xmean
twoStepAhead = phi1*(oneStepAhead-88.8538) + phi2*(85.49-88.8538)  + mu
threeStepAhead = phi1*(twoStepAhead-88.8538) + phi2*(oneStepAhead-88.8538) + mu
fourStepAhead = phi1*(threeStepAhead-88.8538) + phi2*(twoStepAhead-88.8538) + mu
byHandPred = c(oneStepAhead,twoStepAhead,threeStepAhead,fourStepAhead)

predDF = data.frame(sarima.for_predictions = pred$pred, by_hand_predictions = byHandPred)
rownames(predDF) = c("1 step ahead", "2 step ahead", "3 step ahead", "4 step ahead")
predDF

```



**d)** *Compute 𝑃𝑛𝑛+1,𝑃𝑛𝑛+2  and n + 3and compare it with the one produced by  "sarima.for()". Please show the details of you computations.*
```{r}
#the prediction error is P (MSEp)
str(pred)
Pn1 = 32.37
Pn2 = Pn1*(1+(.4301)^2)
Pn3 = Pn1*(1 + (.4301)^2 + (.4424 + .4301^2)^2 )

#Pn1
Pn1

#Pn2
Pn2

#Pn3
Pn3

#Here is the prediction error produced by R:


predErrorDF = data.frame(MSEp_by_hand = c(Pn1,Pn2,Pn3), se_squared = c(5.69^2,6.19^2,7.15^2))
rownames(predErrorDF) = c("n+1", "n+2","n+3")
predErrorDF
```
Comparing the Mean Squared Error of Prediction I calculated by hand with the standard error (squared) that is outputted from the str() function call on my model, they look about the same.


**e)** *Fit an appropriate AR model to 𝑥𝑡using linear regression.*
```{r}
regAR = ar.ols(cmort,intercept = TRUE, order.max = 2, demean = FALSE)
summary(regAR)
regAR


```

**f)** *(f) Find the forecasts over a four week horizon, i.e. 𝑥𝑛𝑛+𝑘,𝑘=1,2,3,4. Compare your results with those obtained in part (c).*
```{r}
#sarima.for(regAR)

predictions = predict(regAR,n.ahead = 4)
predictions


#by hand (so to speak)
phi1 = .4286
phi2 = .4418
intercept = 11.45
oneStep = intercept + phi1*cmort[length(cmort)] +phi2*cmort[length(cmort)-1]
twoStep = intercept + phi1*oneStep + phi2*cmort[length(cmort)]
threeStep = intercept + phi1*twoStep + phi2*oneStep
fourStep = intercept + phi1*threeStep + phi2*twoStep
predictionVec = c(oneStep,twoStep,threeStep,fourStep)
predictionVec #vector of k 1...4 predictions

```


**Question 2**
```{r,results="hide",fig.show="hide"}
#rm(list = ls())
#load data
df = read.csv("/Users/collinkennedy/Google Drive/Programming Folder (4Transfer to Collin's Files V2)/R/ATS/HW5_Q2_data.csv")

timeSeries = ts(df) #create a time series object
plot.ts(timeSeries) #plot it

acf(timeSeries) #looks to be stationary, though there is a hint of seasonality
armaOneOneFit = arima(timeSeries, order = c(1,0,1)) #should i be fitting a model with arima()

#or specifying the parameters by using arima.sim()
armaOneOneSpecified = arima(timeSeries, order = c(1, 0, 1), fixed = c(0.7, 0.4, 0.0))


sarima.for(timeSeries, n.ahead=4, p=1, d=0, q=1, fixed = c(0.7,.4,0))#how do i order the parameters in the fixed argument


#now calculating the first step ahead prediction "by hand"
piJ = ARMAtoAR(ar = .7, ma = .4, lag.max = length(timeSeries))


vecOfXs = rev(as.vector(timeSeries[1:200]))


#1 step ahead prediction right here
firstStepAhead = sum((-1)*piJ*vecOfXs)
secondStepAhead = .7*firstStepAhead
thirdStepAhead = .7*(secondStepAhead)
fourthStepAhead = .7*(thirdStepAhead)
truncPred = c(firstStepAhead,secondStepAhead,thirdStepAhead,fourthStepAhead)


presentationDF = data.frame(sarima_for_output = c(-3.429269,-2.400488,-1.680342,-1.176239),truncatedPredictionByHand = truncPred )
presentationDF



```
The calculations are noticeably very similar.



**Question 3**
```{r}
df2 = read.csv("/Users/collinkennedy/Google Drive/Programming Folder (4Transfer to Collin's Files V2)/R/ATS/HW5_Q3_data.csv")

ts2 = ts(df2)
```

**a)** *plot the time series. Is there an apparent departure from stationarity?*
```{r}
plot.ts(ts2)
pacf(ts2)
model2 = arima(ts2, order = c(2,0,0))
model2

```


**b)** *Determine an appropriate ARMA model for the data. Explain how you determined the order of the model.*
```{r}
#pacf(ts2)

```
I looked at the pacf and saw that it cut off at 2 lags. This indicated it to me that it should be an AR(2) model.


**c)** *Based on your answer in part (b), estimate the parameters of the ARMA model and construct a 95% confidence interval for the estimated coefficients.*
```{r}
confint(model2, level = 0.95)



```
